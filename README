GOsa 2.7 README
===============

* Information

GOsa is a LDAP administration frontend for user administration. It
is NO GENERIC frontend to dictionary servers. Informations are stored
in the way the underlying conecpts suppose them to be stored (i.e.
people accounts are stored in "ou=people" subtrees, etc.) This can
be configured marginally.

Complete setups applying Kerberos, AFS, LDAP, Mail, Proxy and Fax setups
are not trivial at all. You should be familiar with these components and
with your UNIX installation, of cause. This file is (and will not be)
an introduction to any of these components. See INSTALL for a quick
overview about what to do, to get the things up and running. A complete
GOsa infrastructure howto is work in progress and not released yet.


* Translations

GOsa is not available in your native language? Just read on...

Translations (or I18N) in GOsa is done by the gettext library. As a
result, every set of translations is stored inside of one directory
per language as a text file called "messages.po".

For GOsa you've to differenciate between gosa-core and single
gosa-plugins. The core as a translation and every plugin has a seperate
translation, too.

GOsa core can be translated by taking a look at the locales/core
directory. Just take the messages.po file and copy it to some other
location and put your translations into the msgstr fields of this
file. For more comfort, use programs like i.e. kbabel or poedit to
achieve this. You may look at the de/LC_MESSAGES for the way how it
works.

If you're ready with that, create a directory for your language using
the ISO shortcuts (i.e. es for spain) with a subdirectory LC_MESSAGES.
In case of spain this will be

 gosa-core/locales/core/es/LC_MESSAGES

and put the freshly translated messages.po in this directory.

To test this, you've deploy the messages.po file in your running copy
of GOsa and run the "update-locale" command, to let GOsa merge the
translations. Then, Make sure your apache has locale support or, in case
of debian, that the specific locale will be generated (via dpkg-reconfigure
locales).

You may want your translations to be included in the main GOsa repository,
then just send the .po file to me or ask for SVN access.

For gosa-plugins, every plugin has a locales directory. Translation works
like described for gosa-core.

Always run update-locale after you've added translations in order to let GOsa
compile and re-sync the translations.


* NOTES

Be sure that 'gosaUserTemplates' are not able to log into your server,
since they may have no password set. Example configs can be found in
the contrib directory.

Have fun!
