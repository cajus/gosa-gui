GOsa supports two completely different logging services/plugins.

GOsa Log View
=============
This service logs GOsa related actions, like viewing, editing or removing of ldap objects.
In other words, nearly every mouse click in the GOsa ui, will be logged and can then be viewed.

-The database schema is in file 'logging.sql'
-The service plugin is named 'GOsa mysql logging service'.
 (Can be configured in: Administration->Server->Services)


Syslog view
===========
This plugin displays logged system messages, which are stored in a mysql database.
For example, you can configure syslog-ng to log into a database and use GOsa to display 
those messages. This plugin has to be used toghether with the 'Syslog Server' service.

-The database schema is in file 'golog.sql'
-The service plugin is named 'Syslog service database'.
 (Can be configured in: Administration->Server->Services)
