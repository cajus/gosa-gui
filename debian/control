Package: smarty3

Description: Template engine for PHP
 Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically, it
 facilitates a manageable way to separate application logic and content
 from its presentation.
 .
 The Smarty 3 API has been refactored to a syntax geared for consistency 
 and modularity. The Smarty 2 API syntax is still supported, but will 
 throw a deprecation notice. You can disable the notices, but it is highly
 recommended to adjust your syntax to Smarty 3, as the Smarty 2 syntax 
 must run through an extra rerouting wrapper.
