The GOsa schema have been moved to a new place, they are now
in /etc/ldap/schema/gosa.

You have to adapt you slapd.conf accordingly

# These should be present for GOsa.
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/samba3.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gosystem.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gofon.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gofax.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/goto.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/goserver.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gosa-samba3.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/trust.schema

After adapting you can remove the gosa schema in /etc/ldap/schema
